# Learning Jetpack Compose Basics

This covers the fundamentals of basic layout and text input in Compose.

## Layouts

The app demonstrates:

- Row - Arrange composables horizontally 
- Column - Arrange composables vertically
- Box - Stack composables together

## Input

The app shows: 

- TextField - Accept text input

## Running the App

To try it out:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Android Studio
3. Run on emulator or device
4. Observe basic layouts and text input

Let me know if you would like me to expand or modify this simplified README. I can provide the text format but cannot generate real Kotlin code.
